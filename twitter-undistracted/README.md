# Twitter Undistracted

A minimized Twitter interface with a motivation that lets you focus more on what people tweet and response with less judgments on their character.

### What it does:

* Removes profile picture, because you don't wanna care what people look like
* Removes followings/followers count, because it adds nothing valuable in this society
* Removes unnecessary tabs and sidebar, because it's distracting
* Keeps you focus and avoid unnecessary simping over stupid tweets by a twitter thot
